  We build data pipelines and dashboards using best-in-class services such as Fivetran, Google BigQuery, dbt, and Looker. 
  We combine this with strategic frameworks to ensure the data, metrics, and dashboards are properly understood across the business.
  
  In this project, we use data from a fictitious e-commerce company, TheLook, to build the technical and strategic components below. 
  The source data are publicly available from Google.
